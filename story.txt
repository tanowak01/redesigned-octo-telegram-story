Jim was working at the office. He was having a fun day of messing around with Dwight when Michael called him into his office. "I have a special request for you, Jim," said Michael. I need you to become the real life Michael Scarn. Jim eagerly agreed. "Your first mission, should you choose to accept it, is to infiltrate Peter's Paper Products. 

Jim nodded and without a word and left Michael's office, Dwight and Pam tried to urge him to tell them what Michael told him. However,
he just continued walking knowing that "Michael Scarn" had a mission and it needed to be completed with diligence. He got into his
silver Subaru Outback and peeled out of the parking lot. He accelerated through the streets of Scranton, until he arrived at 
Peter's Paper Products. He kept his head down as we overlooked the area, there were security guards everywhere. How on earth 
was he supposed to get inside?
